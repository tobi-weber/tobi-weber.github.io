Levitas is a lightweight wsgi framework.

The main concept is the mapping between urls, regular expressions and a
corresponding handler classes. 
Levitas is designed to be simple to implement and extendable.

Levitas defines basic methods to handle headers, cookies, form data and query strings.
Configuration is easily made with a settings file. 

Levitas provides pre-defined ready to use classes for static files, json-rpc services,
redirection, logging and dynamic content. But programmers don't need to use them,
they can easily develop there own classes.

Levitas works with python 2.7 and python 3.x. No other dependencies are needed.
